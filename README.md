- 👋 Hi, I’m Marcus Pendergrass.
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics and music and the relationships between the two.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Python. I use Java for scientific programming, and am hoping to use Python as a replacement for MATLAB in my rapid application developement projects.
- 💞️ If you are working on mathematics and music, I'd love to see what you're doing!
- 📫 You can reach me at marcus.pendergrass@gmail.com
